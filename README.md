# Wolf-Cogs
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Wolfst0rm/Wolf-Cogs/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Wolfst0rm/Wolf-Cogs)

A list of my own cogs made for [Twentysix's Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)


#### Warnings and Note (General Stuff and Things)

***Not all of this is gaurenteed to work with Red-DiscordBot***  
...If this is the case, I will try as hard as I can to alert the user in the cogs info.json file.  
Again, Some effort will be made to convert the actual cogs to work with Red-DiscordBot.  
As before if you have any issues, please submit them. It will help me track them for when I do fix it.  

***Some of this has been made with a specific Discord Server in Mind***  
..This should be obvious from the bot's responses.  
I will attempt to make some effort to convert all custom-made cogs for general use.  
If you would like to help me with that, please put up issues and pull requests. :smiley:  

### How to submit Issues or get Support

Easiest way to get support is to head to **#coding** channel in Twentysix's [Red - Discord Bot](https://discordapp.com/invite/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) Discord Server.  
There is **no gaurentee** that I will help you out. But if you bring some food and a cold beverage, that can be arranged :wink:
